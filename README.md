# LinkedIn Top Skills Visualization Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to extract significant insights from a Tableau Dashboard presenting LinkedIn's Top Skills visualization for the year 2016. The Tableau Dashboard showcases the top 10 skills sought after by employers, providing a global perspective and further dissecting the data across 14 different countries.

## Insights Derived

### Insight #1: United States Dominance in Skill Demand
- The United States prominently features in 8 out of the top 10 skills, consistently attaining rankings equal to or higher than the global average in 6 of these skills. This points towards a forward-thinking market, potentially linked to its association with Silicon Valleyâ€”an epicenter of cutting-edge technology and innovation.

### Insight #2: Germany's Conservative Market
- Germany doesn't rank below the global average in any skill but secures rankings in only 3 skills: Cloud & Distributed Computing, Statistical Analysis & Data Mining, and SEO/SEM Marketing. This suggests a less adaptive market, where even with a declining demand for Marketing skills, it surpasses the global average, indicating a more traditional market approach.

### Insight #3: Stability in Marketing and Storage Management Skills
- Skills like SEO/SEM Marketing and Storage Systems & Management exhibit stability, as they are the only skills with no countries ranking below the global average. Particularly, Marketing demonstrates exceptional stability, with every country ranking above the global average.

## Conclusion
The Tableau Dashboard offers an intuitive interface that vividly illustrates skill adaptations across different countries. It showcases diverse market behaviors, with some countries exhibiting conservative skill adoption, while others lead as trendsetters. The visualization emphasizes the stability of certain skills like Marketing, contrasting with those ranking below the global average. These insights reflect shifts in skill demands over time, exemplified by Marketing's decline from #4 to #9 between 2016 and 2019. The absence of rankings below average in certain columns underscores that every country within the dataset holds a ranking equal to or above the average.
